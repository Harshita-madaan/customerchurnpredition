Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

📖 Project Description
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services, enabling proactive retention strategies.
The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and modeled using Logistic Regression. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and an interactive prediction system with user input validation.
